# running leaderboard

Back in november i had a bet with my friend that we had to run 15k until that month was over, we used a very popular fitness app to track our progress and to also use the leaderboard capabilities. I found that the app is very limited and it was not to my liking so i went on a search for another app we could use in the future, but i didnt find anything that was suitable. Which is why i decided my first coding project to be a running leaderboard.

The goal is to create a simple project where it is possible to input the runners name, distance of the run and the total time. The program will then calculate and create a leaderboard at any time and at the end of the month it shows the final leaderboard. 

As a software engineering student I have mainly used C++ and C, so i will be writing the code for this project in C++, also because its my most preferred language for the time being.  

  
## Milestones:  
~~ability to input values~~  
saving values for future use  
adding new data to runners  
ranking runners in leaderboard  
changing from console based to web based  
monthly podium
